If there are multiple threads executing insert() simultaneously, 
a condition that more than 1 threads have allocated entry structs 
and have the same tail of the link list will happen. So, if they 
execute the assignment, the last one will overlay all assignments 
before. Thus, some value will be "orphan data" at memory, and will
not be indexed.
